# Stonks Dashboard

A minimum viable product for a data visualisation dashboard. Stock data was used as a case study. Two different APIs are called on refresh providing current stock price, stock price history and new updates on the relevant stock. The stack used: HTML, CSS, JS, Vuejs and firebase clous services is used for hosting and cloud computing.
